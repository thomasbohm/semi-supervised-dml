# Graph-based Semi-Supervised Deep Metric Learning

The goal of Metric Learning is to model similarities of images, i.e. map samples to an embedding space where similar data points are close and dissimilar are far apart. Metric learning is applied to many diverse fields, e.g. to face verification, object tracking, person re-identification, or image retrieval.

Following rencent trends in semi-supervised learning, we apply a pseudo-labeling approach to leverage unlabeled data points. We further extend our method using Graph Neural Networks to model a global context of similar classes.

Work in progress. ReadMe will be updated.
